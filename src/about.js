            <strong>FightHunger</strong> is the collective initiative of three enterprising developers from Bueaâ€™s Silicon Mountain, with the singular aim of tackling the worldwide problem of hunger. In serving a fresh perspective to this global problem, FightHunger provides a platform that offers a two pronged solution to this problem.
            We offer a direct means for those in need of food shelters to find and locate them easily. This targets in particular the Internally Displaced Persons or IDPs that exist within our community, providing them with much needed information that would enable them secure meals and food items.
            We also provide a platform for donations from outsiders, with the money used to support local NGOs in buying food and providing shelter for those who need it most within our community: orphans, IDPs and young mothers with little support from family.
            <p>
               <strong>You can do three things on our platform. search for places around you where free food is distributed, You can organise a free food distribution and announce on the platform, and you can also donate to help us reach out to more hungry people.</strong>
