              <strong>FightHunger</strong>  is an initiative proposed by three students in Cameroon who noticed the problem and negative effects of hunger and decided to build this platform which helps people find locations/venues where they can have free food, and also collect donations and in colaboration with some NGOs organise trainings and workshops teaching these people how to raise money.
            <p>
                You can do three things on our platform. search for places around you where free food is distributed, You can organise a free food distribution and announce on the platform, and you can also donate to help us reach out to more hungry people.
